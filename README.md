Welcome to the interview task :) - Frontend Version
===============================

If something is not clear or you need help - just ask :smile:. Nobody knows everything!

* Read the task
* Create a git project
* Please implement the project according to your own best standards, possibly
  * Code guidelines
  * Structure / architecture
  * Conventions
* Make sure to commit frequently and feel free to stop working on it after 1-2 hours
* Provide an overview which points you would improve if you had more time to work on the project
* show that you thought about the page layout and think about responsiveness
* which elements are needed and which would you recommend as building blocks (header,footer, etc..)
* create/adapt CSS in a maintainable way - simple example and guidelines you would propose to keep it maintainable and feasible for a team of 5+ devs

Scenario - Weathermap api client
---------------------------

Your app is called: "Random Travel Weather"

It is a client for the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather) JSON api.
You can use the jQuery lib at: https://github.com/michael-lynch/open-weather or any other lib of your choice to connect to it.

Features that should work:

* Display the weather at random geographic coordinates
* A form with city and country that fetches and displays the weather in this city

How would parts of what you did be reusable in other Apps of the "Random ..." series?

Have fun!
